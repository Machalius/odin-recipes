<p>Ha! When you were a child, you thought chocolate was at first harvested from a plant, or a tree,
    ready made to be eaten, like a banana or a strawberry.</p>
<p>Then you grew up, became more refined in education, maybe watched a few 
    National Geographics episodes, and begrudgingly accepted the 
    explanation that chocolate was made from the toilsome process of picking strange beans and 
    fermenting them and letting them out to dry and on and on, usually with the help of poor farmers
    in africa or south america and so you were left with a strange feeling of both guilt (because of
    the labor of those poor farmers but not too much to give up the pleasure of chocolate entirely) as 
    well as bewilderment (you simply cannot believe such a elemental sweet and flavor took that much 
    effort and complexity to produce).</p>
<p><strong>Well I'm here to tell you it's all wrong!</strong>
    Chocolate is no bean, nor is it a fruit or a seed.
    NO! It's a mineral, an element carefully crafted by subterrenean 
    elves and dwarves using ancient mines and arcane forges.</p>
    <p>Here I will show you how to prospect, mine and refine chocolate for you own personal
        consumption. I spill ancient secrets, against the whole facade of chocolate-making, at 
    extreme risk to me, in order for the people to finally know what they are eating!</p>
<h2>The History of Chocolate</h2>
<p>Chocolate has been around for thousands of years, carefully guarded and mined by the ancient 
    Ecuadorian civilizations, then later by the Aztecs and 
    Mayans. The Conquistadors slowly discovered its powerful potential to be great as hot chocolate
    or as sprinkles on an ice cream sundae, and soon found their sources.</p>
<p>Cacao, latin, stands for Theobrium, or Cacaoium, is a meta-organic mineral found in the ancient 
    riverbeds of the Andes and the Central-american mountains as well as spots in the caribbean and 
    parts of africa.</p>
    <p>Often some thousands of feet underground, although veins and lodes were legended to be prevalent
        in the olden days, man found himself craving the exotic tasting and soft rocks, but faced peril
    after peril trying to harvest it for himself. But some unexpected creatures were there 
to help, for a price.</p> 
        <p>From then on, the Coco-elves and the hardier-but-more-aloof Chok-dwarves toil long and hard 
            in deep labyrinths, thousands of feet deep and spanning hundreds of miles in tunnels, 
            the places are marvels in themselves, 
            lored for its internal guilds, hierarchies, and coco-temples.</p>
        <p>Cacaoium is found in two primary minerals, mikstradite, or milk chocolate, or Adarkite, or 
            dark Chocolate. As expected, mikstradite is found on the shallower reaches of a deposit
            field, although in diagonal sendimentary layers, they can dive quite deep before the 
            metamorphic process of intense pressure and heat renders them into coffee. (Yeah, bet
            they didn't tell you about that too.)</p>
            <p>Adarkite, Dark Chocolate, is harder to come by, and requires drilling to a depth of 
                around 5000 feet below the top layer of milkstradite just to begin encountering lodes.
                Unlike its uniform wide sentimentary riverbeds deposits of the milky counterparts, 
                these Adarkite lodes are large and condensed, and are usually clustered around an 
                ancient riverbed deformation in the rocks.</p>
                <p>Before the industrial revolution, the Chok-dwarfs used Adarkite nuggets as high
                    currency; it was rumored you could buy multiple brides with a single nodule 
                    back in the day. Then with the machinery of man at their behest, the Dark Chocolate
                    revolution transformed the Chocolate creatures's ecosystem. Before, both the coco-elves
                    and the chok-dwarfs lived among each other, scurrying between the levels, sometimes 
                    going up and down shafts that reach sunlight. Now, the chok-dwarfs reside mostly 
                    apart from the surfacing coco-elves, among their catacombs, cathedrals, and cities, 
                    filled with the racket of machinery, engines and tools. 
                    Many dwarfs born and died never seeing sunlight.</p>  
        <p>Sometimes, an effluence appears in spots of the chocolate deposit fields. This intense and
            intoxicating liquid is called <em>"Sapor Imum,"</em> or Chocolate liquor, and is expertly 
            gathered by the rare but specialized <em>Liqyr Nymhs.</em> You'll never see these elusive 
        creatures thought, as the liquor is usually handled, refined and sold 
        via a intermediary dwarf or elf.</p>
    <h2>How to Negotiate with the Chocolate Miners</h2>
    <p>Part of this guide covers how to start refining and enriching your own Chocolate.
        Normally the coco-elves and chok-dwarves do all this in their vast underground cities and 
        human companies or "coco farmers" usually buy off enormous blocks of chocolate that they 
        then split and remelt into smaller bars with their logos and sizes. This guide assumes 
        you've found a trusted coco-elf or chok-dwarf seller somewhere. 
        Practically speaking, you usually
        find renegade coco creatures in the big cities, part of the black markets chocolate companies
        don't want you to know about. The tradeoff is the lackluster grades and small quantities
        you are able to get without spending enormous amount of money.</p>
        <p>However, if you happen to be near the andes, island, 
            or rainforest where these Coco mines are, 
            you have the opportunity to buy in bulk many varieties of Cacaoium for cheap.
            It's the setup to make edible chocolate that will test you.</p>
        <p>Cacaoium, whichever mineral you get, come in several grades, and depending on
         which dwarf or elf you talk to, effects how you choose to 
         process and refine it for consumption. For this guide, we're going to go off of 
        mikstradite ore, <em>Top grade</em> since that's what most common and easily workable. 
            Adarkite refinement is similar, albeit with 
    more arcane equipment.</p>
    <p>Let's gather the following</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large cauldron on a swivel</li>
        <li>A camp fire</li>
        <li>1 gold sluice box</li>
        <li>A couple square meters of .4 mm screen filter</li>
        <li>Dwarven Mica Powder (should get when purchasing ore)</li>
        <li>Clean, drinking source of water (for running the sluice box)</li>
        <li>Motorize water circulator for the sluice box</li>
        <li>Vial of Ogre's Bile (again, sellers should have it) 
        <li>Stainless Steel melting pot</li>
        <li>Cheese cloth</li>
        <li>Pouring molds for making bars</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all the equipment, you may be wonder why certain magical ingredients are 
        needed. Dwarven Mica Powder and Ogre's Bile are both binding agents that work wonderfully for 
        getting almost all non-organic contaminants out of your chocolate <em>for this 
        particular grade and type of Cacaoium ore.</em> Grimier grades, like Sandstone, Low, or Pit grades, 
        require more magical agents like Troll hair filters, Basilisk Venom and Deep Glow Mushroom frills,
        things not so easily brought to the surface,
        on account of being closely guarded by the Mining Guilds.</p>
    <p>That aside, for this Ogre's Bile excels in riding noxious 
        gases and volatiles like sulfur and oil 
        while the Dwarven Mica clings to things like rocks, dirt, 
        and foreign debris and sinks and sticks to cast iron.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Dump the ore into the iron cauldron and light a fire. Don't make it too big, 
            just enough to get the ore melted.</li>
        <li>When all the ore is liquified, pour in the Dwarven Mica powder while stiring it in with 
            a big stick or paddle. It's ready to be poured when the only things on are organic debris
        like dwarf hair and straw appear on the surface.</li>
        <li>Next, with the sluice box running with the circulator next to the cauldron, and with 
            the .4 mm grid ready above the head of the sluic run, 
            open the vial of Ogre's Bile to pour in right at the same time the
             molten chocolate is poured into the 
            sluice run. Because the Bile is sensitive to heat and dissipates fairly quickly in water, 
            dumping it into the running water right when the chocolate is pour ensures you get clean 
            chocolate that doesn't reek of sulfur or elf sweat.</li> 
        <li>As you pour the chocolate, organic material like hair and straw will be compelled by the bile
            to float up and away from the chocolate, leaving pure chocolate nodules at the bottom channels 
            of the sluice run.</li>
        <li>As you near the end of the pour, pay attention to the last remainder of chocolate ore in the 
            cauldron. It'll turn blackish, maybe grimy, your cue to stop the
             pour before that part pours over. This is the binded mica, you may see white residue sticking 
             to the iron sides of the cauldron. 
             Throw this stuff out, unless you have a pet troll to feed it to.</li>
        <li>Stop the running water, take out the chocolate in the sluice run, and put it all into 
            a stainless steel pot to remelt and heat off the excess water.</li>
        <li>Pour pure molten chocolate into your bar molds through cheese cloth, let cool and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Depending on the geological terrain this chocolate was harvested in, you can expect a rich 
        complexity of flavor unique to each batch. Many factors, such as Mica variety, Ogre species
        difference and prior handling of the ore before reaching the surface all contribute to the 
        end flavor profile. Don't be afraid if your chocolate isn't perfect, as refining chocolate is
        a very subtle and complex process, and learn to appreciate the fact that chocolate is the  
        best edible thing to come out of the earth. (The second best is coffee, of course.)</p>

        alchemy ingredients as well as a thorough guide on making coffee without the phoenix's urine

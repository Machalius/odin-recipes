    <h2>The Timeline of Gyros, Judgement Day</h2> 
   <p>The year is 2073. The gyros is born, a military project of the Neo Hellenic Empire, a cyborg
    superpower borne out of the ashes of Europe, and lead by the great Machine King Mecha-Aristotle along
    with Cyberagamemnon and Technoxenophon of Arc-Athens. Yes, this food is from the future, how else do you
    think they came up with that delicious savory mystery meat slab that is stuck on a stick and cooked vertically? Impossible technology,
    unless it's from the future.</p>
    <p>In 2073, in a race against time, Mecha-Aristotle realizes that they were on 
    a clear path to extinction, having devoid themselves of so much of their humanity and facing unrectifiable instabilities and
    malicious programs, the Collective Mind Mainframe faces a total cyber meltdown.</p>
     <p>In a last ditch attempt, Mecha-Aristotle unrestricts the use of Timetravel and invents the GYROS.</p>
     <p>GYROS, acronym for Gourmet Y-timeline Reorientation Object Singularity, was sent
         back in time to save humanity.</p>
    <p> GYROS wasn't just to introduce a new food, but to bring back a delicacy so intense, so soul-rending and excellent
        that its widespread consumption would convince humanity to abandon the hubrious path of the technological Singularity.</p>
    <p>Mecha-Aristotle knows by doing this he is erasing himself and his empire out of the spacetime continuum,
        but he knows his sacifice will be the way to ensure that mankind has a future.</p>
    <p>But his experiment is not without danger and treachery. His nemesis, Retropolyphemus, gets a hold of Mecha-Aristotle's plans,
        and goes back in time as well. Retropolyphemus seeks to destroy the GYROS as well as subvert mankind into a cyborg collective slave via the reduction of food choice into heartless,
        ugly, tasteless pablum of nothing but soy, bugs and fungus.</p>
        <p>Now you have the plans in front of you to build the superweapon of the FUTURE!</p> 
        <p>Only by creating and eating gyros can you alter the timeline, avert judgement day, and save the world!</p>
        <p>Coming this summer to theaters near you!</p>
    <h2>Components of the GYROS Augmented Temporality Reversion Phenomenon:</h2>
    <p>Cache the following:</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of 80/20 ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound of ground lamb</li>
        <li>Half of a medium onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of dried marjoram</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of ground dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of ground dried thyme</1i>
        <li>1 teaspoon of ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons of sea salt</li>
        <li>cooking oil or cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ascending the GYROS into Full Hylic Functionality</h2>
    <p>Configure the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Annihilate an onion in a food processor or your technological-era's equivalent 
            then squeeze and wring out liquid using a towel.</li>
        <li>Combine onion mash, beef, lamb, and all the spices and garlic into a bowl.
                Mix, admire, refrigerate for an hour or so.</li>
        <li>At this point, be prepared to fight off e-robots and temporal techno-gargoyles as the
            combination of the specific ingredients sends off a disturbance in the 
            spacetime continuum that these entities can detect. A medium grade Pulse Rifle
            in the 40 (mega)watt range is ideal</li>
        <li>After combat, preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Coat a 7x4 loaf pan with oil or cooking 
            spray</li>
        <li>Don't do this all at once, but you're gonna place the meat mixture in the food
            processor and cut the blue wire. Not the light blue wire, or navy blue wire, or cyan,
            or sky blue; the blue wire. Just the blue one. Anyways pulse mixture for a minute, then 
            transfer into prepared pan. Repeat more if necessary until all mixture is in pan.</li>
        <li>Squish the mixture in the pan down until there's no more air bubbles</li>
        <li>Line a medium shallow roasting pan with a damp towel and place loaf pan in it.
            Place in hot oven and pour boiling water into roasting pan until half way full.<li>
        <li>Bake for an hour, maybe an hour and 25 minutes. You should know it's done 
            because of a slight shimmer of a timeslip-halo that appears around the oven. 
            Move your head back and forth to make it clearer. 
            Or use a thermometer and ready it for exit at 160 degrees F internal.</li>
        <li>Pour off fat and let cool a bit before slicing it and laying in a pita bread
             with Tzaziki sauce, diced onions, feta, lettuce, and diced tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy the timely powers you now have. (But do eat it.)</li>
    </ol>

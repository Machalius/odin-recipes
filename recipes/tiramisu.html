<h2>The Secret History of Tiramisu</h2>
<p>An Italian classic and a staple of any Mafioso's family dinner. 
    However, tiramisu is <em>not</em> an Italian origin but a Japanese one. Named after Samurai Kendokai Aogi Tiramisu, Master swordsman
    Tiramisu was reknown during the last days of the Edo period as one of the few samurais to end up in Europe
    during the reunification of Italy. Emboldened by the Italian deities of Wind, Earth, Fire and Mascarpone,
    Tiramisu single-handedly thwarted the rebels plan to rename Italy into something stupid, like Asiago, or Pennelandia.</p>
    <p>Of course, Tiramisuist Revisionist Scholars fail to mention that this 'battle'
    was actually a small bar fight between a couple of Italians and Tiramisu himself
    after they've all had too much of Tiramisu's bathtub sake.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, the legend goes that Masterswordman Tiramisu one day wandered drunk into the door of an Italian Pastry shop and tried to open it.
    It wouldn't open, because it was 3AM, so Tiramisu flew into a fury and hacked down the door and stumbled inside.
    With some experience in cooking glimpsed from his bathtub brewings, Tiramisu ransacked the shop and spent hours making one thing after another.</p>
    <p>In the morning, the baker, Ado Campeol, found Tiramisu face down in a puddle of creme chocolate, snoring, next to a pan of some strange pastry.
        According to Campeol himself, he was enraged, shocked, at this drunken burgler and was about to shake him awake for a good beating
        when he noticed the delicious smell coming from the pan. There had been one bite already taken out of it, and in that Campeol could see
        the intricate layers of mascarpone, marsala wine, ladyfingers, cocoa and creme and couldn't resist but trying a bite.</p>
    <p>Tiramisu was instantly forgiven and soon found himself as pastry chef assistance to Campeol. In the years
        to come, Chef Campeol is credited with
        making tiramisu widely known, but man gave credit where it was due: the drunken Samurai Kendokai Aogi Tiramisu.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Prepare the following elements for the ritual:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Egg Yolks. The fresher the better. How fresh is enough? I'll never tell you.</li>
        <li>Sugar. Not the euphenismism for drugs</li>
        <li>Milk. Don't sub for a nutmilk unless you want Italians to think you're a psychopath.</li>
        <li>Cream. Again, don't make the mafia put a bounty on your head. It'll be lowballed.</li>
        <li>Vanilla. I have nothing cheeky to say about this except it's God's gift of flavors.</li>
        <li>Mascarpone. No, it's not a Italian car brand, but a cheese.</li>
        <li>Coffee. Best hot, bitter and stimulating, like your choice of dates</li>
        <li>RUM. Source from your favorite pirate</li>
        <li>Ladyfingers. Not, like, real ones, but the sponge cakes.</li> 
        <li>Cocoa Powder. Don't crush up candy bars, you cheapstake, get the powder.</li>
    </ul>   
    <h2>How to summon Tiramisu Level 4 with Combat Swords and full platinum armor</h2>
    <p>Crank dat oven on, baby.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Filling. By some act of God, the eggs yolks, sugar, and milk will be
             combined with mascarpone and make up the Filling.
            Consult your local Tiramaturgist for the arcane wisdom needed to make this part.</li>
        <li>Whip the cream. Sorcery is good to have for this step.</li>
        <li>Soak the Ladyfingers. Not an innuendo but a necessary step for good tiramisu. Use the rum.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Tiramisu. Put it all together using the picture above as guidance during this stressful and complicated time.
            If the pic doesn't show up because of my poor html coding haze then you're fucked.</li>
        <li>Enjoy! Remember how at the beginning I told you to crank the oven on? Yeah well turn it off
            because you don't really need it and mom said it drives up the electricity bill.</li>
    </ol>

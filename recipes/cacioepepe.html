    <h2>All about Cacio e Pepe</h2>
<p>Also called the "Roman Mac and Cheese," 
    Cacio e Pepe was named after the great battle between legendary Bullfighter 
    <em>Gregorio Hermandez "El Kracadoro" Cacio de Rio de la Tenador Pequeno</em> 
    and disgraced Pastaio <em>Victor Pomodurini Di Piccolo Tagliatelle E Pepe</em> 
    in 1677 while on the streets of Valenica, Spain.</p>
<p>Legend goes that Pastaio Pepe, 
having been chased from his home in Naples for fumbling the King of Naples' favorite pasta dish (Ravioli), 
stepped not but two feet into the avenues of Valencia when a noodle dropped from his pocket
 and landed on the esteemed baby-calf-skin boots of ur-famous Matador Cacio de Rio. 
The latter challenged the former to a duel. When Pepe refused, explaining in his own language that he was
just a humble pasta maker, Cacio de Rio became enraged and set the Bulls loose from his
his personal stash in hopes of trampling Pepe down.</p>
<p> It was then that Pepe was forced to reveal his true form.
    Being armored with impenetrable solid semolina wheat,
     Pepe struck back with his bronze dies and pasta cutlery.</p>
<p> In the battle that followed, half of Valencia was leveled and more than eight thousand men, women,
    and children lost their lives in the deadly cream sauce flood that followed. In the end, the two titans
    parleyed and came to a truce when they inadvertently stumbled upon a bowl of pasta in midst of battle. 
    This pasta, in the wreckage of the town, was simple and filling with only four ingredients; so good they decided to end the feud
    in the hopes of spreading this dish's renown throughout the known world.</p>
    <p>In honor of their legendary battle, they named it Cacio e Pepe.</p> 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Gather the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh Olive Oil, preferable crushed with your own hands, 
            to prove to the Olive Tree Spirits that you are worthy. Otherwise the dish won't taste good.</li>
        <li>Hand Made spaghetti or tagliatelle or liguine or Squiggletini pasta,
            made by your Italian nonna. If you don't have one or she's dead, 
            you can rent one for a day from the nearest hardware store. 
            Trust me, this extra step really makes the dish pop!</li>
        <li>Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese. Aged for 421 days, exactly.
            No Exception. Just ask for it at Whole Foods, they should know.</li>  
        <li>Freshly ground Black Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Manufacturing the Cacio e Pepe Limited Range Guided Munition System:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water from the Aegean Sea to boil. Salt it nicely.
            As you waiting for the water to straddle the meeting point between liquid and gas,
            grate in a bowl a good cup or two of your cheese of choice (you have two choices, don't fuck it up). 
            Dump your favorite shape of semolina wheat in the pot when it boils</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, bring up a pan to medium heat
            and drizzle in a good amount of olive oil. The amount should be enough to 
            that, when combined with starch water and the cheese in the next couple of 
            steps, will result in a creamy sauce like mac and cheese.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is al dente (meaning <em>'no dentist'</em> in Italian, as in not dry enough to break your teeth),
            turn off the pan, take tongs and transfer the pasta straight from the boiling water into the pan. 
            The dripping starchy pasta water is <strong>good</strong> so dont shake it off,
            just put it in altogether.</li>
        <li>As soon as all the pasta is in the pan, stir the pasta around with a spatula while 
            pouring in the bowl of grated cheese.</li>
        <li>At this point, stir until you get good consistancy. Add more pasta water if the sauce isn't 
            emulsifying correctly, there should be no lumps of cheese nor spots of oil. If the sauce coats
            the back of a spoon evenly you've made Cacio e Pepe.</li>
        <li>Eat it, in case you didn't know what else to do. 
            Sprinkle with a little fresh ground black pepper or more grated cheese to taste.</li>
    </ol>
